        <i>Stitch is an app that helps you stay in touch with the people you care about. It's a funded, minimum viable product in need of incredible engineers to evolve it into something much more: a new type of address book designed for managing relationships, not contacts.</i><p/>
      </p>
      <h3>An introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is <a href="http://akdotcom.com">Akshay</a>. I&rsquo;m an engineer turned product guy trying my hand at the founder/CEO thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was the Platform Lead for Foursquare the past three years. Prior to that I was an engineer at Google for about six years. I left Foursquare in January in search of a new adventure. During that time I built a small little app called <a href="http://lastinitial.com/stitch">Stitch</a>. In July I joined Samsung Accelerator NYC to work on Stitch full time.
      </p>
      <h3>About Stitch</h3>
      <p>
        Stitch is the simple, free way to stay in touch with the people you care about. Add anyone from your phone and Stitch will keep an eye on your calls and text messages to remind you if too much time has passed since you last talked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The overall goal with Stitch is to foster positive, meaningful relationships between people. It&rsquo;s a counterbalance to other social apps which focus our energy on people who share the most instead of the people who matter the most.
      </p>
      <h3>The role</h3>
      <p>
        I&rsquo;m looking for help developing the next evolution of Stitch. As part of Samsung Accelerator there's funding to build a proper team of 4-5 people with a 12-18 month runway, so this is an opportunity to be part of a very small team building something awesome without needing to sacrifice for your art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally you're comfortable working full-stack and with experience building Android apps. That said, I'm open to bringing on anyone with talent who's eager to learn mobile development or prioritizing Stitch for iPhone if that's where your passion lies. Specific title is flexible depending on your experience and appetite for responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        The role is in NYC. If you live elsewhere, but are open to relocating, let&rsquo;s talk.

          Unlike other accelerator or incubator programs, we don't have fixed program durations, nor do we have fixed funding amounts. We understand each product has different timelines and resource requirements, and we work closely with our entrepreneurs to determine what they need to succeed.
