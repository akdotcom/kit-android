        <i>Stitch is an app that helps you stay in touch with the people you care about. It needs a soul and I need a design-focused co-founder to give it one.</i>
      </p>
      <h3>An introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is <a href="http://akdotcom.com">Akshay</a>. I&rsquo;m an engineer turned product guy trying my hand at the founder/CEO thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was the Platform Lead for Foursquare the past three years. Prior to that I was an engineer at Google for about six years. I left Foursquare in January in search of a new adventure. During that time I built a small little app called <a href="http://lastinitial.com/stitch">Stitch</a>. In July I joined Samsung Accelerator NYC to work on Stitch full time.
      </p>
      <h3>About Stitch</h3>
      <p>
        Stitch is the simple, free way to stay in touch with the people you care about. Add anyone from your phone and Stitch will keep an eye on your calls and text messages to remind you if too much time has passed since you last talked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The overall goal with Stitch is to foster positive, meaningful relationships between people. It&rsquo;s a counterbalance to other social apps which focus our energy on people who share the most instead of the people who matter the most.
      </p>
      <h3>The role</h3>
      <p>
        I&rsquo;m on the hunt for a talented designer to join me as a cofounder of this new project. As part of Samsung Accelerator I have funding to build a team of 4-5 people with a 12-18 month runway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stitch is such an intimate product &mdash; it needs to have a soul. At the moment, it&rsquo;s obvious the app was designed by an engineer. The role is an opportunity to be the soul of the app, to have fun with branding/voice in addition to UX and visual design. As co-founder, I expect you to significantly impact product direction and to complement me wearing whatever hats are needed to succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&rsquo;m looking for someone with mobile design experience: both visual and interactive design. Ideally you&rsquo;ve done consumer branding work before, either professionally or on personal projects. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The role is in NYC. If you live elsewhere, but are open to relocating, let&rsquo;s talk.
